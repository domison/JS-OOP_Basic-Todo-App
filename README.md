Basic MVC todo application
https://github.com/domison/

This little todo app is the first project I have programmed with vanilla JS.

As the main purpose of the project is auto-dictatory and to simply code something with JavaScript and get a feel for it, I've elected to use a simple Model-View-Controller architecture to incorporate a very basic CRUD todo application.

The goal is to get myself accustomed to working with JS and take note of some of the differences in the way OOP is handled with it in comparison to Java or PHP.
For efficiency sake, I've decided to combine learning experiences and let this be the first project in which I make use of Git, after reading the "Git Book" (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

Tools used:
VSCode, Git, Chrome DevTools

Languages used:
HTML / CSS / JS
